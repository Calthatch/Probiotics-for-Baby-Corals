Bacterial dynamics in newly settled acropora kenti

This code was used to produce to bioinformatic and statistical code for a paper called "Bacterial Dynamics in Newly Settled Acropora kenti: insights from inoculations with individual probiotic candidates
It is also part of my PhD thesis 

As it pertains to the paper:

Here, newly settled Acropora kenti were inoculated with eight individual bacterial candidates, each native to A. kenti and pre-screened for potential beneficial traits. Coral microbiome and host responses were assessed using 16S rRNA metabarcoding, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, coral growth, photosymbiont density, and phenoloxidase activity, up to five days after the final probiotic inoculation.
